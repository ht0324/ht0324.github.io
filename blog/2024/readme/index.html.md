<h2 id="greetings">Greetings!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my digital garden, where I grow my thoughts! This blog covers a variety of topics, and this post serves as a short guide to help you navigate the different sections. I use categories and tags to organize everything.</p>

<p>To see <em>all</em> the posts within a specific category, please click on the links mentioned in the descriptions below. Here’s a breakdown of the main sections, with a couple of specific post examples linked within each description to give you a taste:</p>

<hr />
<h3 id="hashtags">Hashtags</h3>
<p>Beyond the main categories, I use specific topic tags. Most of the posts are currently in the <a href="/blog/tag/ai">AI</a>, but there are also <a href="/blog/tag/life/">Life</a> posts showing other interests, such as <a href="/blog/2025/Blade-Runner-2049/">Blade Runner</a>. More tags soon to come!</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>
<p>This section contains my unfiltered ideas, recorded more freely than polished blog posts. You can browse all entries in the <strong><a href="/blog/category/thoughts">Thoughts</a></strong> category to explore concepts as they come to me. You’ll find posts like <a href="/blog/2025/takeoff/">Fast AI Takeoffs Are Possible?</a> or thoughts on AI companions like <a href="/blog/2025/ai-girlfriend/">Samantha is here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="paper">Paper</h3>
<p>In the <strong><a href="/blog/category/paper">Paper</a></strong> category, I summarize and discuss findings from academic papers I’ve read. It’s where I digest and share insights from research, such as notes on the <a href="/blog/2025/Scaling-Laws/">Scaling Laws</a>, <a href="/blog/2025/VAE/">VAE</a>, or even philosophical ones like <a href="/blog/2025/mind/">Palatable Conceptions of Disembodied Being</a>. Lots of papers piling up!</p>

<h3 id="blog">Blog</h3>
<p>This is where you’ll find my more polished writing. Posts in the <strong><a href="/blog/category/blog/">Blog</a></strong> category are pieces I’ve revised and proofread. Examples include reflections on development styles like <a href="/blog/2025/vibe-coding/">Vibe Coding</a> or deeper questions like <a href="https://medium.com/@FdForThought/do-llms-possess-an-internal-state-of-mind-20329217f124">Do LLMs Possess an Internal State of Mind?</a>.</p>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="/blog/category/link">Links</a></strong> category serves as an archive of articles, videos, and other resources I’ve found insightful and want to share. It collects resources I found useful, like the link collections from <a href="/blog/2025/Link-Archive-Mar-2025/">March 2025</a> or <a href="/blog/2025/Link-Archive-Feb-2025/">February 2025</a>.</p>

Using these categories and tags, I hope you can easily find the topics that interest you most. Enjoy exploring the garden and the food for thought within!</p>
