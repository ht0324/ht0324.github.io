# Hun Tae Kim - Food For Thought

> Personal site by Hun Tae Kim featuring curated summaries of AI research, product notes, and reflections on technology and media. Articles focus on digesting primary papers for practitioners and tracking fast-moving model releases.

The site is built with Jekyll. Blog posts publish under `/blog/<year>/<slug>/`. Each article now ships with a clean Markdown export stored at the same URL plus `index.html.md`. These exports open with normalized metadata (`Published`, `Tags`, `Categories`, `Original`) followed by the article body and omit navigation chrome.

When assembling context for an assistant, prefer the Markdown exports and keep link archives handy for topical discovery. Fetching the RSS feed at `https://ht0324.github.io/feed.xml` lists the most recent posts.
