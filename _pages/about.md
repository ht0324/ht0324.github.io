Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hun Tae, a senior student majoring in Computer Science at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://skku.edu/eng/) in South Korea.

I also studied at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) as an exchange student for a year. I had a great time there and had the privilege of working with [Prof. Radu Marculescu](https://radum.ece.utexas.edu/people/) at [UT Austin Systems Level Design](https://radum.ece.utexas.edu/) during my stay. Additionally, I had the privilege of working with [Prof. JinYeong Bak](https://nosyu.kr/) at the [HLI Lab](https://hli.skku.edu/). My interests lie in the areas of Large Language Models and Synthetic Data Generation.

Outside of academics, I greatly enjoy watching science fiction movies, reading books (also sci-fi!), and listening to podcasts by Lex Fridman.

Feel free to check out my musings on my [blog](https://ht0324.github.io/blog/) and explore the [links](https://ht0324.github.io/Links/) I've found insightful!
