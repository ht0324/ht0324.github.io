Hi there! 👋

I'm Hun Tae, a Master's Student in Computer Science at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/) (Fall 2025).

I'm deeply fascinated by the nature of intelligence, whether it's organic or synthetic. As of now, my current interest lies in [Mechanistic Interpretability](https://transformer-circuits.pub/) and agentic systems.

Outside of research, I enjoy strength training, biking along the coast, and enjoying science fiction (particularly the works of Denis Villeneuve, Ted Chiang, and Greg Egan). And lately, I’ve been getting into Formula 1 and surfing! 🏎️ 🏄‍♂️

On this blog, I share short notes on [papers](/blog/category/paper/) I've read and [other topics](/blog/category/blog/). Occasionally, I also write about [life](/blog/tag/life/): reflections inspired by books and sci-fi worlds that shape how I think.
