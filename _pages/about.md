Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hun Tae, a junior student majoring computer science in Sungkyunkwan University.

I have also studied at the University of Texas at Austin as an exchange student for a year. I really had a great time there, and I had a privilege to work with [Prof. Radu Marculescu](https://radum.ece.utexas.edu/people/) at [UT Austin Systems Level Design](https://radum.ece.utexas.edu/) during my stay. Currently, my research interests are in the area of Natural Language Processing and Artificial General Intelligence.

Other than that, I really like watching movies, listening to music, and reading books. I also like to travel and take pictures.
