Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hun Tae, a senior student majoring Computer Science in [Sungkyunkwan University](https://skku.edu/eng/) in Seoul.

I have also studied at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/) as an exchange student for a year. I really had a great time there, and I had a privilege to work with [Prof. Radu Marculescu](https://radum.ece.utexas.edu/people/) at [UT Austin Systems Level Design](https://radum.ece.utexas.edu/) during my stay. I also had the privlage to work with [Prof. JinYeong Bak](https://nosyu.kr/) at [HLI Lab](https://hli.skku.edu/). My interests are in the area of Large Language Models and Synthetic Data Generation.

Other than that, I greatly enjoy watching science fiction movies, and reading books(also sci-fi!).

Feel free to check out my musings on my [blog](https://ht0324.github.io/blog/), and the [links](https://ht0324.github.io/Links/) I found insightful!
