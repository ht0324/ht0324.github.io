Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hun Tae, a senior student majoring in Computer Science at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/) in South Korea.

I spent a year as an exchange student at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I worked with [Prof. Radu Marculescu](https://radum.ece.utexas.edu/people/) at [Systems Level Design Group](https://radum.ece.utexas.edu/). I also had the privilege of working with [Prof. JinYeong Bak](https://nosyu.kr/) at the [HLI Lab](https://hli.skku.edu/). Currently, my interests lie in the areas of Large Language Models and Synthetic Data Generation.

Outside of academics, I enjoy watching science fiction movies, reading books (also sci-fi!), and listening to podcasts.

Feel free to read my thoughts on my [blog](https://ht0324.github.io/blog/) or browse through the [links](https://ht0324.github.io/Links/) I've found insightful!
