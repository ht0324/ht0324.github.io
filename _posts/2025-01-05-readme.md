Welcome to my garden! This is a short post about how to navigate my blog, as there's a lot going on. I post about a variety of topics and categories, so I've used hashtags and tags to separate posts by topic. Here's a breakdown:

*   Hashtags: These are used to categorize the various topics I explore.
*   [Blog](https://ht0324.github.io/blog/category/blog): This tag mainly contains polished writing. These are posts where I have clearly articulated my thoughts and spent time proofreading to ensure they are proper blog posts.
*   [Rambling](https://ht0324.github.io/blog/category/rambling): This tag contains my unfiltered thoughts, recorded in an unrestricted way. Here, I explore my ideas freely, and you will find a different kind of value and enjoyment compared to the polished blog posts.
*   [Links](https://ht0324.github.io/blog/category/links): This tag serves as a link archive. It's an archive of articles I've read and videos I've watched that I found insightful. There are many things I want to share with you, and this tag serves as an archive.
*   [Papers](https://ht0324.github.io/blog/category/papers): This tag is used for summarizing and discussing the findings of academic papers that I've read.

Based on these tags, I believe you can easily find what I'm interested in promptly and conveniently. I hope you enjoy my garden and my food for thought!
